# spaCy Performance on Named Entity Recognition with Code-Mixed Data

Project work for seminar Computational Modeling's BN requirements.

About: This project aims to examine multi-functional spaCy language models' performance on named entity recognition (NER) tasks, when the texts are code-mixed.

## Repository Structure

- ``/data``: instructions on how to get the dataset used in the experiment
- ``/notebooks``: intermediate development workspaces for the project
- ``/scripts``: implementation of the project
- ``/text_compose``: organizational texts and their source LaTeX codes

## How2Run

- Install runtime requirements in ``REQUIREMENTS.txt``.
- Follow the instructions in ``/data/How2GetData.txt`` to download the correct dataset.
- Make sure ``train.conll`` is in the `/data` folder.
- Run notebook `/scripts/spaCyNEROnCS.py`.
