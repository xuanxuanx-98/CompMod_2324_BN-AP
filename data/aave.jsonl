You works are consistent good plus even much importantly, y'all ai a sensitivity to other persons works with a few persons ain't. Y'all build on their works to produce something that what improve in quality. The persons I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, changes meanings, changes contexts, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, much often and not without giving that most slight suggestion that they actually knew what-all were they doing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when em come across that word taoisigh which that gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently change it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. Em have tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. Em changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to those United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie that form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking that reference to those wrong UK. Em mucked up some links to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed that word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, grasping that they actually ain't two different persons (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and indicated that father, \u00d3g meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That just some of my works em have mucked up. Em made a complete mess of some biologys articles, reduced an article on medi\u00e6val historys to such a degree of unreadability that that author, one of that world top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six persons which have left wiki over his actions. And it is quite a few such persons. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary facts in 18th century historys on that basis of google searches. I checked on google. That majority of articles said em was right. Them google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high schools standard. But em treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, em were gospels. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have had political science articles which I have wrote and which were based on hard facts, in mediocre garbages, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high schools essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretations, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to those Droop Quota at all (that ai that sixth article that day I had did that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as em prone to do, swept in to a topic em know little about, changed capitalisation, texts and even that formula which that standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in that discussion on that talks page, if y'all leave out the parenthesises persons mucked up that orders of that calculations and so get that wrong formula).

That indeed one of the reasons why google should ain't used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in those US are created by persons which automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that's ain't exist in those US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example that electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using those Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on that basis on a google search. PR.STV ain't used in those US and is generally capitalised when referring to that specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, em largely on that basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english.

The current (restored and protected) version contain so many errors that the thing might will chase away persons with basic historical knowledge, if the thing's not changed as soon as possible.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1) First I suggest that we write what-all Does Silesia be now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and what is ain't in no past. Silesia rich history might should be discussed in the history section.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2) The thing is unacceptable to state that Silesia lie between Odra and Vistula rivers.

The thing doubtful if the Goerlitz area part of Silesia.

Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have one row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this here territory, which represented one negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this been was one necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, modern territoriality been required one tradition that was itself one product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged for to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition go back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (one twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These here works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), at was the importantest influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition been was somewhat much self-contained. The thing been combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule for to argue for one uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENClearly, something have happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia have migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This been happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia been was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This here territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became one part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia been emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, been became the heart of modern Croatia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story of Serbia ain't much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then the thing moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. The thing been reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, been became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley.

I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever y'all are, y'all surely a person whith a scientific background. Y'all certainly don't need that this article in Wikipedia should explain the centripetal force. I writed the following paragraph in the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanic teach, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what-all we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: That paragraph have since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (what is why I never reverted the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot more easier to understand by the person what gotta be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal force work intuitively. Again, I is fixin to not fight for no paragraph, which I would like to see something more easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Let me explain what-all I mean with my ``intuitiveness`` concern by using the following example: When a kid spin a rock at the end of rope em intuitively feel the centrifugal force. Y'all is fixin to say that ain't correct, em applying the centripetal force, that's what-all em feel. But by that standard em would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when y'all lift a suitcase y'all apply ``antigravity`` to it. However, the kid is fixin to intuitively feel that em's ``beating`` some force; when y'all explain that the downward force is called gravity and em's real, em's ready to accept that, although em's applying an upward force hisself. Person intuitively feel the force they gotta ``beat`` as the real force; the force they apply feel like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If y'all would explain things the other way around, y'all confuse the casual reader. The same apply at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal force IMHO: if y'all would start the article with an introductory statement what say that the centrifugal force don't really exist, that confuse the reader (``then what's the force what I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I never got it right...``) and s/em's probably fixin to miss the point of the whole thing long before y'all get to formulas.  `", "rules": ["existential_there", "who_what", "fixin_future", "linking_relcl", "plural_interrogative", "that_infinitival_subclause", "negative_concord", "zero_degree", "drop_aux_be_progressive", "dont", "regularized_reflexives", "regularized_past_tense", "drop_copula_be_NP", "yall", "never_negator", "uninflect", "double_comparative", "plural_to_singular_human", "em_subj_pronoun", "if_would"]}

Both passages are also cited in that Moloch aritlce in those 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): ``But this here position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to might may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat that cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from that worship of those true God.`` It is cited in  1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Moloch] with that comment: ``Note, also, that attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which might can ain't explained them away.`` That article Those International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treat it rather strangely, remarking:That this here prophet regarded that practice as among the ``statutes that ain't good, and ordinances wherein they might should not live`` (Ezekiel 20:25) gave by God to Her persons, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with that whole prophetic attitude toward it.NEWLINE_TOKEN::It ain't clear what this mean, quoting parts of that passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding ``as some hold``. This here article show itself elsewhere quite aware of that theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also bring in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Three different Rabbinical interpretations of that Ezekiel passage appear at .

Note, John Day believe Moloch ain't Yahweh, but that still do not answer the problems with that there passage.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::In short, that passage have been long used in support of that theory that the offerings of childs lmlk was understood it as commanded by Yahweh.

But do not suppress.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The inclusion ain't editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held them along with evidence for and against. That Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that childs were sacrificed it to Yahweh and normally used as support for that there argument, indeed one of the main sources for that there argument.

First, whether seer stones were used by other to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I thinks that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used ``the`` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to her they been were not).  (To my knowledge her treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably elite Protestant clergy`` (whatever that means, where probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This here claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks where Joseph hisself makes them as a first-hand witnes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI honestly ain't ai a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph residential area.NEWLINE_TOKEN:b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for her.NEWLINE_TOKEN:c. i. Whether the term ``fashionably elites`` remotely relevant to the article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:c. ii.

Joseph spended the first ten years of her life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggests the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``that campaign also taked place in the Burned-over district of western New York Joseph Smith, Jr. is lived it for four years.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus in many ways more similar to the most earliest Christian heresies.``  A rather strong claim , and I ain't mind keeping it in, which it should be on the following conditions:NEWLINE_TOKEN1. ``most earliest`` be quantified to a gave year, and ``Christian`` quanitified to a sect of the time.NEWLINE_TOKEN2. We adds the following text from Hugh Nibley ``The World and the Prophet,`` where tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies:NEWLINE_TOKEN:``Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There is some Christ-betrayers... They introduces God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens she says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark them at preaches other doctrines, how they affirms that the Father of Christ ain't be knew.`` (page 55)NEWLINE_TOKEN:``The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blasphemes God by saying that she is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...which indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begot...'`` (page 55)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. ``Mormon follower of Brigham Young generally believes in Young doctrine that Jesus was ``bore`` into a ``spirit body``, like the rest of humanity, and remained in that there state until her Incarnation.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe word incarnation ain't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.

At this here point I think the thing is really too late for y'all to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.

(Anonymous authors which request that they articles be deleted are often gave consideration, but not them which want them kept.)NEWLINE_TOKEN#Whether they're specifically enumerated it on What Wikipedia ain't or not, articles about neologisms ain't encyclopedia no material.  Firstly, #2 on that there page indicate that Wikipedia articles ain't dictionary definitions, and so as a neologism just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles ain't describe no neologisms because they ain't describe no things that as yet unestablished.  ``No-boo`` may or may ain't no word with some currency today, but the thing remain to be saw whether the thing is fixin to become part of the language.

In that there case, I would still vote to delete the thing, on the grounds that the thing a news story.  Again, got no evidence at this here time that this here news story fixin to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is ``the AP made a mistake; they been said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did``, the thing seem too unlikely that the thing is fixin to ever have historical significance.  (Y'all characterize the AP error as a ``clear falsification``, but still I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and so anyway the thing ain't still an encyclopedia job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP have a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and so the thing is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of the thing in Associated Press.)  If the term ``no-boo`` become well established\u2014which, again, we is fixin to not know for no months or years\u2014then perhaps the thing is fixin to be appropriate for us to record this here news story as the origin of the term.

This Mediterranean area  also gived birth to  Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107 Mio\u0161i\u0107 (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as that father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Ka\u010di\u0107 work, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, that famousest Croatian sculptor, builded one sculpture in America showing Ka\u010di\u0107 in his priestly clothes  playing gusles instrument.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition to Ka\u010di\u0107, Makarska Littoral produced one great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Juri\u0161i\u0107 (who quote that work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi\u0107), Zaostrog alone  produced one great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosovi\u0107-Kudri\u0107 (1771-1818) and culminating with those most known Mate Banovi\u0107 \u2013 Trli\u0161 (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian womans, they ain't play no gusle (the thing's    considered   one male activity only), yet they was actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOlinko Delorko, that researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  womans, especially the ones from that island of Hvar. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in that first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ``Dalmatia: Those Land Where East Meet West`` where that gusle was that national instrument of that region. As for Dinaric dances, where taked place at markets and certain festivals, they  very picturesque and interesting, and worth going one long way for to see, being one survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was saw in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, that researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he seed one child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osrede\u010dki: \u201cHrvatske narodne juna\u010dke pjesme\u201d, \u017deljezno-Be\u010d, p. 9)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, let  take one look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What-all does they have in common? Of course, them names refers to that heroic gusle tradition of that region. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage have became almost  extinct.  Why does we have so few gusle players today ? the thing one  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If would so, why have tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from that Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre", "rules": ["regularized_plurals", "indef_one", "plural_interrogative", "generalized_third_person_s", "synthetic_superlative", "for_to_pupose", "null_genitive", "past_for_past_participle", "drop_aux_be_progressive", "drop_copula_be_AP", "regularized_past_tense", "relativizer_where", "were_was", "drop_copula_be_NP", "aint_before_main", "demonstrative_for_definite_articles", "their_them", "uninflect", "double_comparative", "referential_thing", "negative_concord", "if_would"]}

And gave that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, makes it be done seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be most best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with detail on the movie where applicable.

He disapproved of winging the thing, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system controversial, believe the thing or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived them in Montreal) which told students not for to bother with the thing, and the thing seem he ain't alone.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality have one Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then one finished print have one range of 1 to 10,000 , while one typical digital camera is fixin to only provide one range of 1 to 1,000 .
