If one person chooses not to love God, or chooses one life separate from God, that be done amounts to the same as choosing death, since cutting theyselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means one more better translation will be ``whoever does not believe in him gon destroy hisself``. Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God love is sometimes described as one ``river of fire``. Hence both God goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person free will.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * Also, Jesus did ain't to die. To say say was forced to die will imply that some external force or law is more greater to God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy always reject this notion, and rather says say Jesus choosed to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death power was overcame. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, which that ain't the same as saying say God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like one steed.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * The Jews did ain't to accept Jesus as their Messiah. simply was their Messiah; it ain't an elect office, and their choices did not change no fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection.

I'd lose that ``terrorism`` pages entirely in that process (dumping they text & talk into the new articles), as we're never fixin to agree on which acts are ``terrorism`` and which are not (and y'all know we're not, yeah?). the articles just give the facts then we can leave ``terrorism or not?`` decisions up to the readers.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Having done considered that concept, I support the thing.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when em comes across that word taoisigh which that gaelic plural for taoiseach and so which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word.

Em changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to those United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie that form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking that reference to those wrong UK. Em mucked up some links to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady for to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed that word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, grasping that they actually ain't two different persons (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and indicated that father, \u00d3g meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That just some of my work em done mucked up. Em made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on medi\u00e6val history to such a degree of unreadability that that author, one of that world's top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six persons at done left wiki over his actions. And there is quite a few such persons. Not a lot, but enough for to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on that basis of google searches. I checked on google. That majority of articles said em was right. Those there google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But em treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, em was gospel. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI done had political science articles which I done wrote and so which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely thrown up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to those Droop Quota at all (that ai that sixth article that there day I had did that done been 'hit'. In that there case Michael Hardy as em prone for to do, swept in to a topic em knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even that formula which that standard DQ formula taught (in that there form because as already happened in that discussion on that talk page, if y'all leave out the parenthesises persons mucked up that order of that calculation and so get that wrong formula).

That indeed one of the reasons why google might should ain't used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, website mentions in those US are created by persons at automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that's ain't exist in those US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example that electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using those Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on that basis on a google search. PR.STV ain't used in those US and is generally capitalised when referring to that specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, em largely on that basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it for to suit American english.

NEWLINE_TOKEN*Alex edition on the 9 and 10 November was did using the talk page but he made edit before discussing them and, gave the complete history of the article, the edit was too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to them being systematically reverted (what common use in the WP for that there behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This here behaviour was clear one mistake of Alex, and I put it to his ain't read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problem was one result of confusion caused by his Asperger Syndrome.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Nobody can agree ``not to make unilateral edit`` (Adam expression) in no page for whatever reason, this is one bit too generic and have no deadline.NEWLINE_TOKEN*He aware of the damage he may incur them in (damage for hisself) if he repeat the above behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Before Viajero suggestion, Alex had told  he was going to ``try to stay out of Mother Teresa page for one while``.
