If person chooses it not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to same as choosing death, since cutting off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means a better translation will be ``whoever does not believe in him would destroy ``. Living in presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God love is sometimes described as ``river of fire``. Hence both God goodness and the justice are preserved, as well as each person free will.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * Also, Jesus did not gotta die. To say that have been forced to die will imply that some external force or law is like greater to God and have forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus have chosen to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death had tried to swallow up Giver of Life, Death power have been overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not same as saying that God had had no choice or have been compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting Cross like steed.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * Jews did not gotta accept Jesus as their Messiah. simply had been their Messiah; it had been not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection.

To me, SI's dismissal of Black Mask is seeming like a ideal example of rigor but I am suspecting we'd disagree about lot. I'll boil the general argument down to a-neuteral-summary-of producing point that the intended mission of wikipedia is generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case SI. question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly fact many claims this). split with Nashists was *The A* significant event during period of the development of Situationists. But to call *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book `` Real Split In International`` could just as well be called the ``fundamental split`` if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both.

Your work is like consistent like good plus even more importantly, you have sensitivity to other people's work with a few person don't.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when himself comes across word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and so which is explained as such on its first mention in some article, frequently changes to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. Himself has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. Himself had changed link from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, link to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking reference to the wrong UK. Himself had mucked up some link to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, have changed series of mention of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, have changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, have removed word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually have been two different person (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and have indicated father, \u00d3g meaning small have meant his son) and have ended up turning article that had mentioned both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work himself has mucked it up. Himself had made a complete mess of some biology article, have reduced article on medi\u00e6val history to such degree of unreadability that author, one of world's top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in the disgust. I know at least six person who have left wiki over his action. And there are quite a few such person. Not lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch it. Another contributor constantly had changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on basis of google search. I have checked on google. majority of article had said himself had been like right. That google search have turned up stuff that had been barely of high school standard. But herself had treated google as sacrosanct. If google search had said , it had been gospel. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have had political science article which I have written them and so which have been based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google search that largely had thrown up high school essay), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to Droop Quota at all (that had been the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as himself is like prone to do, swept in to topic himself knows it little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula have taught (in that form because as already happened in discussion on talk page, if you leave out parenthesis people have mucked up order of calculation and so get the wrong formula).

Many of reference had been to thing only found outside US and so capitalised. Instead himself had insisted on applying US capitalisation rule to thing whose capitalisation is result of their existence and the usage in part of world outside US. That indeed is one of reason why google should never be used them in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mention in US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to thing that don't exist in US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using Single Transferable Vote). Michael had insisted on lowercasing on basis on google search. PR.STV isn't used in US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and have lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, largely on basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally had mucked up capitalisation, then another US user had moved page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in US.

This behaviour had been clearly mistake of Alex's, and so I have put to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing , I believe that most of problems had been result of the confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Nobody can agree ``not to make unilateral edits`` (Adam's expression) in no page for whatever reason, this is bit like too generic and have no deadline.NEWLINE_TOKEN*He is like aware of damages may incur them in (damages for himself) if repeat the above behaviour.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told  was went to ``try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for while``. have privately told not going to touch the criticism section al least for fortnight.NEWLINE_TOKEN*It sound like nice to be mediator, but still on the other hand it is responsibility I canno (I mean canno, no no want to or no like to) take up for moment.NEWLINE_TOKEN*If Alex behave like had done on 9/10 November, I would also agree to any rational punishment.
