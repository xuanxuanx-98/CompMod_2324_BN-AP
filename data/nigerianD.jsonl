Your works are consistent good plus even more importantly, y'all have a sensitivity to other people's works with a few people don't.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when he is coming across word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and so which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently is changing it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He already tried change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and indicated father, \u00d3g meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just already mucked of my works he mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biologys articles, reduced an article on medi\u00e6val historys to such a degree of unreadability that author, one of world's top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I am knowing at least six already left which left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough mangle everything they are touching. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary facts in 18th century historys on basis of google searches. I checked on google. majority of articles said he was right.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI already had political science already wrote which I wrote and so which were based on hard facts, in mediocre garbages, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high schools essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretations, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had did that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone do, swept in to a topic he is knowing little about, changed capitalisation, texts and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in discussion on talks page, if y'all are leaving out parentheses people mucked up orders of calculations and so get the wrong formula).

Many of references were to things only found outside US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existences and usage in parts of world outside US. That indeed is one of reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in US are created by people which automatically and incorrectly is applying US capitalisation to things that isn't existing in US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, is largely on basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up capitalisation, then another US user moved page to another name that is referring to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely knew in US.

By no means I intend my opinion be regarded as more important and any other's, but still for obvious reasons some persons expecting it. Here it goes. historys of these texts are in  which I shall clear these evenings. texts end at ``EOT`` below.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter reviewing historys and talking to , I have gotten the following visions of facts (which is basis for my opinion expressed below):NEWLINE_TOKEN*Alex's editions on 29 were did without discussion on talks page. This was clear a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but still I think we may assume good faiths here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follow summaries, diffs, etc... NEWLINE_TOKEN*Alex's editions on 9 and 10 November were did using talks page but still he made edits before discussing them and so, gave the complete historys of article, edits were too bold be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in WP for those behaviours) and in end to blocking of page. These behaviours were clear a mistake of Alex's, and so I put it to his not having read the complete historys. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of problems were a result of confusions caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Nobody can agree ``not make unilateral edits`` (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reasons, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.NEWLINE_TOKEN*He is aware of damages he may incur in (damages for hisself) if he repeat the above behaviours.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told  he was going to ``try stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while``. He has privately told me he not coming touch criticisms section al least for a fortnight.NEWLINE_TOKEN*It sounds nice be a mediator, but still on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want or do not like ) take up for moments.NEWLINE_TOKEN*If Alex behaves like he did on 9/10 November, I is coming to also agree to any rational punishments. I want stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.NEWLINE_TOKEN*I do not think that Alex is coming to cause any further problems.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBefore stating my opinion, I would like everybody know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediations was did without either mine or Alex's prior consents. He later expressed his concerns about this to . I feel it is only fair mention it here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHence, my opinion is:NEWLINE_TOKEN:Unblock page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then resources of Wikipedia prevent these non cooperative behaviours will be used, as with any other user.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut I mean as with any other user. If he were coming appear in problem page, he has be told in his talks page in advance; if he were coming be banned, then he has be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedures are.
