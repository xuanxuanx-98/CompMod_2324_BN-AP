Living in presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians are describing Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as the ``river of fire``. Hence both God's goodness and the justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.Are NEWLINE_TOKENING: * Also, Jesus did not gotta die. To say that he have been forced to die would imply that some external force or law is more greater than God and have forced God to act against His will.

When Death had tried to swallow up Giver of Life, Death's power have been overcame.

Your work is like consistent like good plus even much importantly, y'all have a sensitivity to other persons's work with a few persons don't. Y'all build on their work to produce something that which improves in the quality. persons What that was talking them about arrive at an article, chop around, change meanings, change the context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, much often than not without giving the most slight suggestion that they actually have known what-all were they doing. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when he comes across word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and so which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He had changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking reference to the wrong UK. He had mucked up some links to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, have changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, have changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, have removed word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually have been two different persons (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and have indicated father, \u00d3g meaning small have meant his son) and have ended up turning an article which what had mentioned both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked it up. He had made a complete mess of some biology articles, have reduced an article on medi\u00e6val history to such a degree of unreadability that author, one of world's top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in the disgust. I know at least six persons who have left wiki over his actions. And you have quite a few such persons. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch it. Another contributor constantly had changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on basis of google searches. I have checked on google. majority of articles had said he had been like right. Those google searches have turned up stuff that had been barely of high school standard. But she had treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search had said , it had been gospel. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have had political science articles which I have written them and so which have been based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely had thrown up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to Droop Quota at all (that had been the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is like prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows it little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula have taught (in that form because as already happened in discussion on talk page, if y'all leave out parenthesises persons have mucked up order of calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention had been classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know it much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change , in most a-version-is producing cases that like so wrong it would be savaged if any student had repeated in a class.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAmerican english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of references had been to things only found outside US and so capitalised. Instead he had insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and the usage in parts of world outside US. That indeed is one of reasons why google should never be used them in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in US are created by persons who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using Single Transferable Vote). Michael had insisted on lowercasing on basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and have lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally had mucked up capitalisation, then another US user had moved page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system much widely known in US.

{"text": "`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Ivo Banac)...The bit of nonteleological historyNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the great problem already benefitted that our understanding of the common and individual history of South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This already explained because nationalist historiography regularly explained modern development as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connection that may be of our own making. For example, if we are looking at the current political map of area and are comparing to that from era of settlement we see it that the present political division are not corresponding to those from the early medieval period. Croatia mainly the coastal area from Rasa River in Istria to Cetina River, the little bit to east of city of Split. Down coast from the original Croatia, we have the row of unfamiliar Slavic territory that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called them Pagania (literally, land of pagan), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia ( Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environ), and Dioclea (the southern portion of contemporary Montenegro with Bay of Kotor and northwesternmost portion of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today Novi Pazar, in Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, which represented the negligible area around source of Bosna River, where we now are finding Sarajevo and its environ. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was the necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territory, from Krk in north to Ulcinj in south.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, modern territoriality required the tradition that was itself the product of the modernity. Thus, unrelated tradition were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition is going back to Chronicle of Priest of Dioclea (the twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translation (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated them into Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` history of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These work then became material for Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same history (Orbin) were Serbianized through translation of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian history of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It already happened the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with experience of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for the uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published it between 1884 and 1887).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENClearly, something happened in span of ten century. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia already disappeared. center of Croatia already migrated from Adriatic to north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stage. During High Middle Ages, heart of Croatia was on Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to Ottomans in sixteenth century and became the part of Bosnia. During Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operation in the seventeenth century, framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shank-one, to north, to modern Slavonia; other, in south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became heart of modern Croatia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to Ibar-Morava valley; then toward valley of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in course of Karadjordje uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or are prorexing) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around Vrbas River and Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for century, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner.

I agree Rjstott that purpose Wikipedia. AN, whoever y'all are, y'all are surely person a scientific backgrounds. Y'all certainly don't need this article Wikipedia to explain that centripetal force. I have written that following paragraph that article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is like important to understand right that start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. the default, objects tend to move a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches it, away that 'orbit', so these contexts, the default there is only a centrifugal force works. That centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, that object that end rope etc). Therefore, that centrifugal force is a natural component a circular movements, while that centripetal force is what-all we conventionally call that force keeping that object ' orbit'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: That paragraph since been removed the favor a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements my explanation might have been like misleading or imprecise a scientific perspectives (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are lot like easier to understand that person who needs to be explained how does the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I would not fight no paragraph, but still I would like to see something easier to understand that casual reader that introduction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Let me to explain what-all Does I mean my ``intuitiveness`` concerns using that following example: When kid spin rocks that end rope he intuitively feels that centrifugal force. Y'all would say that isn't like correct, he is applying that centripetal force, that's what-all he feels. But that standard it would be like difficult to explain gravity  that same rationale, when y'all lift suitcase y'all apply ``antigravity`` it. However, that kid would intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when y'all explain that that downward force is called gravity and so it's like real, he's like ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. Persons intuitively feel that force they gotta ``beat`` that real force; that force they apply them feels that artificial part that equations: that upward force to beat gravity is like artificial, that gravity keeping that suitcase that grounds is like natural. y'all explain things that other way around, y'all confuse that casual reader. The same applies an intuitive level centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if y'all start that article an introductory statement which says that that centrifugal force don't really exist, does that confuse that reader (``then what's that force that I'm beating them holding on that rope? Maybe I didn't get right...``) and s/he's most probably going to miss that point that whole thing long before y'all get formulas.  `", "rules": ["existential_there", "inverted_indirect_question", "regularized_plurals", "plural_interrogative", "remove_det_indefinite", "shadow_pronouns", "acomp_focusing_like", "present_perfect_for_past", "to_infinitive", "corr_conjunction_doubling", "dont", "drop_aux_have", "yall", "will_would", "definite_abstract", "it_dobj", "demonstrative_for_definite_articles", "mass_noun_plurals", "chaining_main_verbs", "null_prepositions", "negative_concord", "object_pronoun_drop"]}

First, whether seer stones have been used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith had lived.``  (I'll explain why I am thinking that's like important later.)  Still Second, whether Joseph had used ```` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and so whether such efforts have been religious experiences (to him they have been not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts have been limited to the time prior to obtaining Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably are eliting Protestant clergy`` (whatever that is meaning, which probably is needing changing) have been not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by remarks what which Joseph himself is making as the first-hand witness.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI honestly don't have the recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is like fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:a. Whether use of seer stones have been restricted to Joseph's residential area.NEWLINE_TOKEN:b. Whether treasure hunting had been the religious experience for him.NEWLINE_TOKEN:c. i. Whether term ``fashionably are eliting`` is remotely like relevant to article.NEWLINE_TOKEN:c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the too least.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2s. ``the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. have been raised`` is like facially inaccurate.  Joseph had spent the first ten year of his life in Vermont, with only four year in New York prior to First Vision. I am suggesting the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``that campaign also had taken place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways much similar to the earliest Christian heresies.``  The rather strong claim , and I amn't minding keeping in, but still it should be on the following conditions:NEWLINE_TOKEN1. ``earliest`` be quantified to the gave year, and ``Christian`` have quanitified to the sect of time.NEWLINE_TOKEN2. We are adding the following text from Hugh Nibley's `` World and Prophets,`` what that is telling of the time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs have been heresies:NEWLINE_TOKEN:``Ignatius of Antioch are writing to Trallians: 'You have some Christ-betrayers... They are introducing God as being like unknown.' And to Smyrnaens he is saying: 'Do ye, therefore, are marking those who is preaching other doctrines, how they are affirming that Father of Christ cannot be knew.`` (page 55)NEWLINE_TOKEN:``The great crime of heretics in general, according to Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they are blaspheming God by saying that he is like unknowable and not Father of Christ...but is like indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begot...'`` (page 55)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4. ``Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally are believing in Young's doctrine that Jesus have been ``bore`` into the ``the spirit body``, like rest of the humanity, and have remained in that state until his Incarnation.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe word incarnation isn't fitting context of sentence, and so I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.

Are Thanking taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and are basing your arguments keeping The No-boo them, and also being like polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't no place for to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond your points here instead.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN#First, you should be like aware that anonymous users is signing up accounts just to argue the article being voted are still effectively anonymous users, and still not going to have their votes counted.  this point I am thinking is really like too late for you to establish a history Wikipedia would result your vote being counted.  Again I am referring Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus this information.  (Anonymous authors is requesting that their articles be deleted are often given the consideration, but not that is wanting them kept.)NEWLINE_TOKEN#Whether they're specifically enumerated it What Wikipedia isn't or not, articles neologisms isn't encyclopedia no material.  Firstly, #2 that page is indicating that Wikipedia articles isn't dictionary definitions, and so as a neologism is just a particular kind word, an article a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe no neologisms because they cannot describe no things are as like yet unestablished.  ``The No-boo`` or may isn't no word some currency today, but it is remaining to be seen whether it would become part the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant\u2014which time would likely not come no months or years\u2014then we can write an article it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.NEWLINE_TOKEN#If the article question isn't about a word but actually about an event called ``The The No-boo Affair``, then it ought to be entitled The No-boo Affair.  that case, I would still vote to delete , the grounds that is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence this time that this news story going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance the news story is ``the AP made a mistake; they have said some people booed a speech but really the nobody ``, it seems too unlikely that it would ever have historical significance.  (You are characterizing the AP error a ``clear falsification``, but still I am seeing no evidence malicious intent the AP, and so anyway it isn't still an encyclopedia job to document falsehoods the AP.  the AP has a history or pattern such falsehoods, and so is like well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note it Associated Press.)  the term ``no-boo`` is becoming well established\u2014which, again, we would not know no months or years\u2014then perhaps it would be like appropriate for us to record this news story the origin the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles other recent news stories.  However, are stories definite historical signficance, and so that isn't should also be deleted.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Wikipedia is wanting articles items are currently the news, yes.  this case there is many things related the story that might want to look up.  we no already had , we could add articles George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this ``The No-boo Affair`` isn't an encyclopedic topic the news; is a breaking news story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is like important to understand that an encyclopedia isn't simply no gathering assorted facts, but rather a secondary source is compiling significant pieces human knowledge have already been like well-established by other sources.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome even claim a Serbian origin Croatian Dinaric culture a line traditional more greater Serbian propagabda (all \u0161tokavian persons and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritages is primarly Croatian.

Also, a first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, the contemporary Croatian writer (bore Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan tells us the story his uncle (also Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also the home Anica Begin (bore Kalafatovi\u0107, 1816), the daughter famous gusle player Ante.
