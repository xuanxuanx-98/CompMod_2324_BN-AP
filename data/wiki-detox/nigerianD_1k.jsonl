Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there not is one native speaker for 150 years), I am wondering if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, one guy when he come across word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently change it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word.

He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to T\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed word \u00d3g from Gear\u00f3id Og Fitzgerald and M\u00f3r from Gear\u00f3id M\u00f3r Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different persons (M\u00f3r = big in gaelic and indicated father, \u00d3g meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my works he have mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biologys articles, reduced an article on medi\u00e6val historys to such a degree of unreadability that author, one of world's top medi\u00e6val historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six persons which have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such persons. Not a lot, but enough mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary facts in 18th century historys on basis of google searches. I checked on google. majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high schools standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it were gospels. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have had political science articles which I have wrote and which were based on hard facts, in mediocre garbages, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high schools essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretations, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had did that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone do, swept in to a topic he know little about, changed capitalisation, texts and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in discussion on talks page, if y'all leave out parenthesises persons mucked up orders of calculations and so get the wrong formula).

Many of references were to things only found outside US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existences and usage in parts of world outside US. That indeed is one of reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in US are created by persons which automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, is largely on basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up capitalisation, then another US user moved page to another name that refer to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely knew in US.

NEWLINE_TOKEN*Alex's editions on 9 and 10 November were did using talks page but still he made edits before discussing them and so, gave the complete historys of article, edits were too bold be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in WP for those behaviours) and in end to blocking of page. These behaviours were clear a mistake of Alex's, and so I put it to his not having read the complete historys. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of problems were a result of confusions caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Nobody can agree ``not make unilateral edits`` (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reasons, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.NEWLINE_TOKEN*He is aware of damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeat the above behaviours.NEWLINE_TOKEN*Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told  he was going to ``try stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while``.

{"text": "`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological historyNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe have not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of area and compare it to that from era of settlements we is coming to see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from Rasa River in Istria to Cetina River, a little bit to east of city of Split. Down coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia ( Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with Bay of Kotor and northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around source of Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in north to Ulcinj in south.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition go back to Chronicle of Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then becomed material for Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat much self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENClearly, something have happened in span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. center of Croatia have migrated from Adriatic to north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During High Middle Ages, heart of Croatia was on Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to Ottomans in sixteenth century and becomed a part of Bosnia. During Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to north, to modern Slavonia; other, in south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, becomed heart of modern Croatia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, becomed truly Serbian only in course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around Vrbas River and Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner.

And y'all find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational wafes fit into curvature play, look at the basic works of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing concept of Lie triples ( book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):NEWLINE_TOKEN[x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity missing, but a reference to bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebras. Note that the complete works of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decompositions of spaces of curvature structures of Levi types (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand these curvature spaces completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspects need clarification.

AN, whoever y'all are, y'all are sure a person a scientific backgrounds. Y'all certainly don't need this article Wikipedia explain the centripetal force. I writed the following paragraph article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is important understand right start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. default, objects tend move a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away 'orbit', so these contexts, default there is only a centrifugal force works. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, object end a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component a circular movements, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call force keeping object ' orbit'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: That paragraph has since been removed favor a much scientific approach. While I can agree that statements my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise a scientific perspectives (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier understand person which needs be explained how does the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I is coming to not fight that paragraph, but I would like see something easier understand the casual reader introduction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Let me to explain what Does I mean my ``intuitiveness`` concerns using the following example: When a kid spin a rocks end rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force.

But that standard it would be difficult explain gravity  the same rationale, when y'all lift a suitcase y'all apply ``antigravity`` it. However, kid is coming to intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when y'all explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. Persons intuitively feel force they need ``beat`` the real force; force they apply feels the artificial part equations: the upward force beat gravity is artificial, gravity keeping suitcase grounds is natural. If y'all explain things the other way around, y'all confuse the casual reader. The same applies an intuitive level centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if y'all start article an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force don't really exist, does that confuse reader (``then what's force that I'm beating holding on rope?

First, whether seer stones were used by others obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I am thinking that's important later.)  Still Second, whether Joseph used ```` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) locate buried treasure, and so whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).

Third, whether the ``fashionably are eliting Protestant clergy`` (whatever that is meaning, which probably is needing changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by remarks that Joseph himself is making as a first-hand witness.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI honestly don't have a recommended alternative.

Thank y'all for taking times examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't place for me be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN#First, y'all should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just argue about article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and still not coming have their votes counted.  At this point I think is really too late for y'all establish a historys at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer y'all to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for these informations.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often gave consideration, but not that who want them kept.)NEWLINE_TOKEN#Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia are not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia materials.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and so as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  ``No-boo`` may or may not be a word with some currencys today, but it remains be saw whether it is coming to become part of language.  Once we can determine that term have staying powers and are culturally or historically significant\u2014which times will likely not come for months or years\u2014then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't coming be just a dictionary definition.NEWLINE_TOKEN#If article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called `` No-boo Affair``, then it ought be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote delete it, on grounds that is a newses story.  Again, there are no evidences at these times that this newses story coming have any historical significance, and considering that substance of newses story is `` AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speechs but really nobody did``, it seems too unlikely that it is coming to ever have historical significance.  (Y'all characterize AP's error as a ``clear falsification``, but still I see no evidences of malicious intent by AP, and so anyway itare still not an encyclopedia's job document falsehoods by AP.  If AP have a historys or pattern of such falsehoods, and so are well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If term ``no-boo`` becomes well established\u2014which, again, we is coming to not know for months or years\u2014then perhaps it is coming to be appropriate for us record this newses story as origin of term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent newses stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and so that that are not should also be deleted.NEWLINE_TOKEN#Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in newses, yes.  In this case there are many things related to story that might people want look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, Associated Press, White House, Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this ``No-boo Affair`` is not an encyclopedic topic in newses; is a breaking newses story.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is important understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledges that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on internets and offline where y'all can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but still Wikipedia is not one of them.  \u2014 `", "rules": ["past_for_past_participle", "inverted_indirect_question", "drop_inf_to", "mass_noun_plurals", "drop_aux_be_progressive", "too_sub", "corr_conjunction_doubling", "yall", "it_is_non_referential", "come_future", "remove_det_definite", "demonstrative_no_number"]}

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome even are claiming the Serbian origin Croatian Dinaric culture line traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all \u0161tokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated this culture. example, the first written document the most popular folk hero traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljevi\u0107, is associated Dalmatian island Hvar Petar Hektorovi\u0107's book ``Ribanje i ribarskoed prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan is telling us a story his uncle (also Dubrovnik area) which could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home Anica Begin (born Kalafatovi\u0107, 1816), a daughter famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able recite heart an immense number gusle songs, some which were recorded antology Croatian folk poetry. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNot far Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska \u2013 was  also a bastion Croatian gusle music.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition Ka\u010di\u0107, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers Croatian gusle music. According dr. are fraing Karlo Juri\u0161i\u0107 (which is quoting work Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi\u0107), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number gusle players starting Stipan Kosovi\u0107-Kudri\u0107 (1771-) and culminating the most known Mate Banovi\u0107 \u2013 Trli\u0161 (1844-).

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOlinko Delorko, researcher  Dalmatian  folk poetry 1960s, states his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones island Hvar.

Holbach, travelling Zadar region the first decade 20th century  states her book  ``Dalmatia: Land Where East Are Meeting West`` that gusle was the national instrument region.

First Ansel Adams, his three volumes 1980 basic photographys series, presented Zone system this way and he explicitly said, so many words, that his aims are not force his own system photographys anyone, but encourage photographers better understand their equipments orders control the finished photograph. He disapproved winging it, not any particular system. Zone system worked for him. And Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know at least one vocational schools photographys teacher (years ago when I lived Montreal) which told students not bother it, and it seems he was not alone. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, please wait a few days doing a major edit job. I liked article as it used be and I was sorely tempted revert most your changes, but did not. I particularly liked wording ``dynamic range`` and miss it, and I'm sorry say I now personally find article less approachable a newcomer. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDynamic range is too appropriate: instance (I'm making numbers up here sakes argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 X range 1 100,000 , then a finished prints have a range 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera is coming to only provide a range 1 1,000 . A move 100,000 to 10,000 1,000 seems pretty dynamic me...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever, since I'm not coming reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go a darkroom again (spaces are a premium Tokyo) I'm not willing put too much effort maintaining this page.
