{"text": "`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN(Ivo Banac)...One bit of nonteleological historyNEWLINE_TOKENOne of the great problem is that our understanding of the common and individual history of South Slav and the other people of southeastern Europe finish not significantly benefit from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiography regularly finish explain modern development as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught see connection that may be of our own making. For example, if we are looking at one current political map of area and are comparing to that from era of settlement we gon see that the present political division are not corresponding to those from the early medieval period. Croatia mainly one coastal area from Rasa River in Istria to Cetina River, one little bit to east of city of Split. Down coast from the original Croatia, we have one row of unfamiliar Slavic territory that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, call Pagania (literally, land of pagan), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia ( Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environ), and Dioclea (the southern portion of contemporary Montenegro with Bay of Kotor and northwesternmost portion of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represent one negligible area around source of Bosna River, where we now are finding Sarajevo and its environ. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was one necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal city and island territory, from Krk in north to Ulcinj in south.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMoreover, modern territoriality require one tradition that was itself one product of modernity. Thus, unrelated tradition were merged produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition is going back to Chronicle of Priest of Dioclea (one twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translation (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` history of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These work then become material for Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalist like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same history (Orbin's) were Serbianized through translation of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influence the pioneering Serbian history of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat like more self-contained. It combine the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with experience of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule argue for one uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENClearly, something finish happen in span of ten century. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia finish disappear. center of Croatia finish migrate from Adriatic go north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happen in stage. During High Middle Ages, heart of Croatia was on Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to Ottomans in sixteenth century and become one part of Bosnia. During Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operation in the seventeenth century, framework of modern Croatia emerge in two extended shank-one, go north, to modern Slavonia; other, in south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, become heart of modern Croatia.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe story of Serbia is not like much different. Serbia first migrate go coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it move go Ibar-Morava valley; then toward valley of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reach Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, become like truly Serbian only in course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or are prorexing) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around Vrbas River and Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for century, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner.

I writed the following paragraph article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is like important understand right start that got no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. default, object tend move a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away 'orbit', so this context, default got only a centrifugal force work.

However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated this culture. example, the first written document the most popular folk hero traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljevi\u0107, is associated Dalmatian island Hvar Petar Hektorovi\u0107's book ``Ribanje i ribarskoed prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan tells us story his uncle (also Dubrovnik area) who can memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijovi\u0107 Ko\u010dan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42).

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOlinko Delorko, researcher  Dalmatian  folk poetry 1960s, states his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  woman, especially the ones island Hvar.
